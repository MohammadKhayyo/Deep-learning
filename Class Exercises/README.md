### <a name="ex1"></a>Ex1 - XOR very simple neural

In this exercise, we tackled the classic problem of approximating the XOR function using a simple neural network. Given the non-linearity of the XOR function, this exercise serves as a foundational example to understand the power of neural networks.

### <a name="ex2"></a>Ex2 - Gradient Descent and Momentum for Polynomial Function Minimization

Exploring the optimization landscape, this exercise introduced the Gradient Descent optimization technique and its variant that utilizes momentum. By attempting to minimize a polynomial function, we observed the behavior, advantages, and pitfalls of these optimization strategies.

- **Main Concepts**: Optimization, Gradient Descent, Momentum

### <a name="ex3"></a>Ex3 - PyTorch MNIST example with target modification

Building on a classic dataset, this exercise had us work with the MNIST dataset. However, instead of the standard classification task, we introduced a twist by modifying the targets, adding complexity and furthering our understanding of model versatility.

- **Main Concepts**: PyTorch, Dataset Manipulation, Classification
