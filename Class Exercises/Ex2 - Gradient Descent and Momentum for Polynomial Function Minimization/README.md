# Advanced Gradient Optimization Techniques

Hello, dear reader! Are you passionate about machine learning and optimization? Or perhaps, are you a talent seeker who appreciates the nuances in the world of optimization algorithms? Then, let this repository be a testament to a rigorous exploration of gradient descent and its variants.

## Overview

Gradient Descent, while being one of the most fundamental optimization techniques, can sometimes fall short. By employing advanced algorithms, such as the Momentum method, we can traverse the loss landscape more efficiently, escaping local minima, and accelerating convergence.

In this repository, we dive deep into understanding:

1. Basic Gradient Descent optimization on the functions \(x^2\) and \(x^4\).
2. The Momentum method's application on the same functions and comparing its performance with basic Gradient Descent.

## Key Features

üéØ **Minimalistic Design**: The code is clean and concise, focusing only on the core logic and mathematics.

üìà **Meticulous Implementation**: Both Gradient Descent and Momentum are implemented from scratch, showcasing a deep understanding of their mechanics.

üìê **Mathematical Prowess**: Derivatives are calculated and utilized for optimization, highlighting a strong grasp over calculus.

üöÄ **Efficient Convergence**: Through iterative adjustments, the code ensures that the algorithms converge to the desired minimums efficiently.

## Quick Start

**Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

**How to Run**:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Execute the script using:
   ```bash
   python gradient_optimization.py
   ```

## Expected Outcomes

1. Discover the minima of \(x^2\) and \(x^4\) using Gradient Descent.
2. Achieve faster and potentially better convergence using the Momentum method for the same functions.
3. Compare and appreciate the differences between Gradient Descent and Momentum method.
