**Tools and Technologies Used**:
1. **TensorFlow**: An open-source library for numerical computation and machine learning. TensorFlow provides a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources.

2. **Keras**: An interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library.

3. **PyTorch**: Another open-source machine learning library with a focus on flexibility and dynamism. Great for both research and production.

4. **NumPy**: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions.

5. **Pandas**: A data analysis and manipulation library. Useful for preprocessing data.

6. **Matplotlib**: A plotting library. Useful for visualizing data, training curves, etc.

7. **Scikit-learn**: A tool for data mining and data analysis. It includes various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms.

8. **OpenCV**: A library for computer vision tasks. Can be used in conjunction with deep learning models for image-based tasks.

9. **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

10. **CUDA & cuDNN**: Technologies for doing GPU computation. Essential if you're training large neural networks.

11. **Colab**: A Google research project for prototyping machine learning models on free GPU resources.

12. **Seaborn**: A data visualization library based on Matplotlib. Provides a higher-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

13. **NLTK & spaCy**: Libraries for natural language processing tasks.

14. **Fast.ai**: A deep learning library that makes training neural nets more accessible.

15. **Dataset-specific libraries**: For instance, when working with the MNIST or CIFAR-10 datasets, one might use specific loaders or helper functions.
