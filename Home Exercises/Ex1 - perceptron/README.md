# Perceptron-based Classifier README.md

## Overview:

This program is a simple implementation of the classic perceptron algorithm used for binary classification. It processes a dataset, trains a model using the perceptron algorithm, and then predicts labels for the dataset, finally reporting the accuracy.

## Features:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
    - Reads a comma-separated dataset.
    - Shuffles the dataset to ensure randomness.
    - Converts labels into binary (`positive` -> 1, `otherwise` -> 0).

2. **Perceptron Training**:
    - Randomly initialized weights.
    - Uses the perceptron learning rule to update weights.
    - Continues to adjust weights for a specified number of iterations.

3. **Prediction**:
    - Uses learned weights to predict the labels for data.
    - Calculates accuracy as a percentage of correctly classified instances.

## Instructions:

1. Ensure you have `numpy` installed.
2. Save your dataset with the format: `feature1, feature2,...,label` where label is either `positive` or `negative` (or any other binary distinction).
3. Execute the program:
    ```bash
    python your_program_name.py [path_to_your_dataset]
    ```
    Example: `python your_program_name.py data_ex1.txt`
4. Observe the final weights and model accuracy printed to the console.

## What sets this apart?

- **Error-handling**: Incorporated in the data processing step to ensure smooth functioning.
- **Flexibility**: The code can handle datasets of different feature sizes, as the weights are initialized dynamically based on input size.
- **Adaptability**: Adjust learning rate, threshold, and number of iterations as per your requirements to optimize model performance.

## Potential Interview Discussion Points:

- **Code Structure**: Discuss the modular design of the code, making it easy to read and modify.
- **Perceptron Algorithm**: Dive deep into the perceptron learning rule and its implications.
- **Enhancements**: Explore how the model can be improved, perhaps using more advanced techniques or incorporating additional features.
- **Real-world Applications**: Discuss potential scenarios where this simple binary classifier could be applied effectively.
