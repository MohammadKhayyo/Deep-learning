# CIFAR-10 Data Utilities & Two Layer Neural Network

Hello and welcome! If you're reading this, you're likely interested in diving deep into how to utilize and structure data utilities for the CIFAR-10 dataset and to create a basic two-layer neural network. 

## Features üåü
1. **Cross Compatibility**: This codebase is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.
2. **Optimized Data Processing**: CIFAR-10 data is loaded, reshaped, normalized, and prepared for classifiers in one smooth operation.
3. **Neural Network from Scratch**: Train a two-layer neural network without the bells and whistles of major deep learning frameworks. Get to know the inner workings!
4. **Visualizations**: Understand training dynamics by plotting loss and accuracy graphs.

## Files üìÇ

### 1. `data_utils.py`
*Handles the CIFAR-10 data loading and preprocessing.*

- **Functions**:
  - `load_pickle(f)`: A Python 2 and 3 compatible function to load pickled data.
  - `load_CIFAR_batch(filename)`: Load a single batch of CIFAR.
  - `load_CIFAR10(ROOT)`: Load all CIFAR batches.
  - `get_CIFAR10_data(...)`: Load and preprocess CIFAR-10 data for classifiers.
  - `get_CIFAR10_data_SVM_softmax(...)`: Special preprocessing for linear classifier.

### 2. `Main_two_layer_net.py`
*Main driver code to invoke data utility functions, train the neural network, and visualize results.*

- **Highlights**:
  - Loads CIFAR-10 data.
  - Defines network parameters and initializes a two-layer neural network.
  - Trains the network and displays training dynamics.
  - Cross-validation for hyperparameter search.

### 3. `neural_net.py`
*The brain of our operations. Defines the architecture, forward and backward passes, loss computations, and training mechanics of our two-layer neural network.*

- **Class**:
  - `TwoLayerNet`: Defines the neural network, forward & backward prop, loss computation, and training loop.
  
## How to Use ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Ensure you have the CIFAR-10 dataset in the `'cifar-10-batches-py'` directory.
2. Run the `Main_two_layer_net.py` to train the two-layer neural network.
3. Analyze the visualizations to see the training dynamics.
4. Dive into `neural_net.py` to understand and potentially modify the architecture.
