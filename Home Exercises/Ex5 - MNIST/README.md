# `Autoencoder for Image Denoising README.md`

---

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the autoencoder image denoising project! This repository contains a robust PyTorch implementation of an autoencoder designed for denoising images, specifically tested on the MNIST dataset. If you're looking for an intelligent deep learning solution to clean up noisy image data or if you're keen on understanding the ins and outs of autoencoders, you're in the right place.

## 🔍 How It Works

### The Autoencoder

The autoencoder comprises two main components: an **encoder** and a **decoder**.

- **Encoder**: It compresses the input into a compact latent representation. Implemented as a series of convolutional layers.
- **Decoder**: It reconstructs the input from the latent representation. Implemented using transposed convolutional layers.

### Noise

The program offers an option to introduce Gaussian noise to the images, simulating real-world scenarios where data might be corrupted. This noisy data is then passed to the autoencoder to be denoised.

### Evaluation

Post-training, the program visualizes the original, noisy (if introduced), and the reconstructed images from the test set, providing a clear understanding of the model's denoising capability. Additionally, it plots the loss over epochs, allowing for a clear view of the model's training trajectory.
