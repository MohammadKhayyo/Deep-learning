# Advanced Optimization Techniques for Deep Neural Networks

Welcome to a comprehensive demonstration of advanced optimization algorithms implemented from scratch to understand their intricacies and behaviors. This code not only showcases the foundational principles of deep learning optimization but also paves the way for understanding how each technique performs on real-world datasets.

## 🌟 Features:

1. **Neural Network:** A simple two-layer neural network implementation that serves as the base for showcasing various optimization algorithms.
2. **Optimization Techniques:** In-depth implementations of popular optimization methods such as SGD, Momentum, Nesterov Momentum, Adagrad, RMSprop, and Adam.
3. **Dataset:** Utilizes the `make_moons` dataset to demonstrate the effects of these optimization techniques on classification tasks.
4. **Experiments:** A systematic evaluation loop that measures the accuracy of each optimization method over multiple runs, providing insights into their average performance and consistency.

## 🚀 Quick Start:

1. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, mainly:
    - numpy
    - scikit-learn
2. Simply run the script: `python filename.py` (replace "filename.py" with the name you saved the script as)
3. Watch as the magic unfolds! The program will print the performance (mean accuracy and standard deviation) of each optimization technique after running the experiments.

## 📈 Why This Code?

- **Crystal Clear Implementations:** Each optimization method is clearly implemented, with each step commented for better understanding.
- **Customizability:** Easily adjust parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of iterations to observe different behaviors.
- **Performance Metrics:** Not just implementation, the code provides empirical results, offering insights into how each method might perform in real-world applications.
